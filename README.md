# Beammp-Egg-Lite
Modified version of the BeamMP Pterodactyl egg that runs on Alpine Linux to conserve space
Works on x86_64 and arm64

I'm still working on moving the Docker containers and the builds for BeamMP for Alpine to Github but for now you can test out this egg that pulls the binaries from my server.
